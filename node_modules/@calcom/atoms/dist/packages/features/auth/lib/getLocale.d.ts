 * This is a slimmed down version of the `getServerSession` function from

 *
 * Instead of requiring the entire options object for NextAuth, we create
 * a compatible session using information from the incoming token.
 *
 * The downside to this is that we won't refresh sessions if the users
 * token has expired (30 days). This should be fine as we call `/auth/session`
 * frequently enough on the client-side to keep the session alive.
