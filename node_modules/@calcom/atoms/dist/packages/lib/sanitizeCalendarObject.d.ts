/**
 * sanitizeCalendarObject is a utility function that cleans up and normalizes
 * the iCalendar data from a DAVObject before parsing it using the ICAL.js library.
 * It addresses issues with incorrect line endings, line folding, and unwanted line
 * breaks before colons, semicolons, and equal signs.
 *
 * @param {DAVObject} obj - The DAVObject containing the iCalendar data to be sanitized.
 * @returns {string} The sanitized iCalendar data.
 *
 * NOTE: This function is a workaround for handling improperly formatted iCalendar
 * data. It is recommended to use a well-formed iCalendar data source to avoid
 * the need for these manual corrections. This function may not cover all edge cases
 * and might still cause issues with specific inputs.
